<h2 id="data-1"> What is data visualisation?</h2>
        
        <p>Data visualisation is the presentation of information in a pictorial or graphical form. It allows decision makers to view analysis of data graphically, so they can understand difficult concepts or distinguish new patterns.</p>
        
        <p>The aim of data visualisation is to make data values easier to understand and exchange information and ideas. It is the easiest way for humans, brain to collect and clarify large amounts of data. It also enables business users to have the capability to use data perceptively, without the need of an expert. </p>

            <h2 id="data-2">History of Data Visualisation</h2>
            
            <p>The idea of utilising pictures to comprehend information has been present for centuries, from maps and graphs in the seventeenth century to the innovation of the pie chart in the mid 1800s. Several decades later, one of the best of graphical statistics illustrations is said to be the map of Napoleon's invasion of Russia done by Charles Minard, a French civil engineer in the 1800s. The map delineated the size of the army forces and also the withdrawal of Napoleon's from Moscow -  and connected that data to temperature and time scales for a more thoroughly understanding of the event. </p>

            <p>However, it is technology which urged the concept of data visualisation. The process of big amounts of data at a really fast speed was made possible by computers. In today's world, data visualisation has developped rapidly into a mix of science and art which is certain to change the business landscape in the next few years. </p>

            <h2 id="data-3">Importance of Data Visualisation</h2>
            
            <p>The human brain finds it easier to picture data in graphs or charts than reading over spreadsheets or reports. Data visualisation is a fast and simple way to communicate ideas in a universal manner - and users can try different things with various situations by making slight changes. </p>
            
            <p><strong>Data Visualisation can also:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                <li><strong>Pinpoint a part that need a change.</strong></li>
                <li><strong>Simplify the factors which affects customer behaviour.</strong></li>
                <li><strong>Help users to comprehend which items to place where.</strong></li>
                <li><strong>Foresee sales volumes.</strong></li>
                </ul>

            <h2 id="data-4">How Data Visualisation is being used?</h2>
            
            <h4>The understanding of data rapidly</h4>
            <p>By utilising graphical representations of business data, the businesses can see a lot of information in a comprehensible and compact ways, thus drawing conclusions from that data. As it is well easier and faster to figure out information in a graphical form compared to a spreadsheet, businesses can address issues or answer questions in a more convenient way.</p>
            
            <h4>Identification of  relationships and patterns</h4>
            
            <p>A lot amount of complex information can be understood when presented in a graphical format; Businesses can recognize parameters that are highly correlated. Some of the correlations will be obvious, but others won’t. Recognising those relationships aids businesses to focus on parts which are most likely to influence siginificant aims. </p>
            
            
            <h4>Identify upcoming trends</h4>
            
            <p>Data visualisation can help businesses to find trends in the market thus giving them an advantage over the competition and in the end, affect the bottom line.</p>
